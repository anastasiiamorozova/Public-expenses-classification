The analysis is a starting point of investigation published at Frontstory.pl:

During eight years of PiS rule in Poland, forest districts transferred tens of millions for 'socially useful purposes.' Many of these funds went to churches and organizations that promoted 'national values' or supported the logging of the Białowieża Forest. Money also went to entities from which foresters profited.

1. First, we requested information on how much money was allocated to which organizations over the last five years.
2. After receiving the data, which included about 17,000 records, we created a DataFrame for further cleaning.
3. After standardizing the data, I created a dictionary to define which recipient organization served what 'socially useful purpose.'
4. Based on this, I calculated how much money was allocated for each purpose.
5. To simplify visualization, I identified the region of each organization and showed the money flows accordingly: https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/17420915/

It was no surprise that most of the money supported church organizations.
